For years, **Elementor** users have structured their websites using **Sections, Columns, and Inner Sections**. It was the standard way to build layouts—until now.

Recently, while setting up a church website, I ran into an unexpected issue: I couldn’t create **inner sections.** At first, I thought it was a bug, but after some digging, I realized that **Elementor had officially replaced the old system with Flexbox Containers**.

At first, I wasn’t sure how to feel about it. But after experimenting, I was mind-blown. This was a complete game-changer.

## **The Moment of Realization**

I had my usual workflow in mind:

1. **Create a Section** →
    
2. **Add Columns** →
    
3. **Nest Inner Sections** inside columns →
    
4. **Place content within each section**
    

But when I tried to add an inner section, **it wasn’t there.** Gone. Completely removed.

Frustration kicked in. *How was I supposed to structure my content without inner sections?*

That’s when I decided to take a step back and truly understand Elementor’s **new container system.**

## **What’s Different in Elementor?**

Instead of relying on **Sections and Columns**, Elementor now uses **Containers**, which are powered by **Flexbox and CSS Grid**.

* **Flexbox Containers** allow you to control alignment, spacing, and direction with ease.
    
* **Grid Containers** give you full control over complex layouts with **rows and columns** without needing extra nesting.
    
* **No more inner sections!** You can now achieve the same effect by nesting containers inside other containers.

## **How I Made It Work**

After some trial and error, I figured out the magic formula:

1. **Use a single Container instead of Sections.**
    
2. **Nest additional Containers inside** instead of using Columns.
    
3. **Use Flexbox for alignment** and CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
    
4. **Enjoy a more streamlined, performance-optimized design!**
    

Once I got the hang of it, I realized just how powerful and flexible this system is. The layouts I created looked cleaner, and responsiveness was easier to manage.

## **Why Elementor’s New Layout is a Big Deal**

Here’s why **Containers** are an upgrade:

✅ **Better Performance:** Fewer nested elements = faster load times.  
✅ **More Flexibility:** You can create any layout using just Flexbox & Grid.  
✅ **Easier Responsiveness:** No more struggling with mobile adjustments.

At first, I thought Elementor broke something, but now I see that they actually made it better.

## **Final Thoughts**

If you’re struggling with the **new Elementor layout system**, don’t panic! Embrace **Containers** and experiment with **Flexbox & Grid**. It might take a little getting used to, but once it clicks, you’ll never want to go back.
